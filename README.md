# Gradient_Boosted_Models
using packages xgboost to create gradient boosed models
In this research project i wanted to see if there was a corilation in positive retuurns a techniqaul indicator as alot of sourse and scammer online will tell you this is the only mean to do so. So to start my project i collect data on varius stocks to roughly approximate the sp500 based on markets such as healthcare , banking and so on. you can see the png files these labeled with its respective ticker that the price of the price forcast display little to no pattern in in first and third graghs but in the center gragh there is a clear trend then this is when i started debation on the means of my model and it complexity and decided with a gradient boosted model using the xgboost libary to make up down predition as a oppose to adaboost.

after making my models and went through and noticed larger companies tedn to respect the indicators more meaning they move with tradition trading concepts and apple had the best accuracy of buy and sell of around 80 percent for buy prediction.

The project is incomplete as i now need to test further i have test alibaba stock with it and it performed a 15 percent profit over 6 months. This code seems to work much better at buy signals as oppose to sell signals and the time frame for this is 3 day.
